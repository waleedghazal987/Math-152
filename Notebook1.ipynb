The word \"float\" refers to the fact that the decimal (or binary, for computers) point can float around (as in 1.2345 or 12.345 or 123.45 or 1234.5 or 0.00012345).

Python 2.x would signal which type of integer was being used, by placing the letter \"L\" at the end of a long integer.  Now, in Python 3.x, the programmer doesn't really see the difference.  There is only the *int* type.  But Python still optimizes computations, using hardware functionality for arithmetic of small integers and custom routines for large integers.
